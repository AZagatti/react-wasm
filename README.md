## 📝 Organization
_**credits to Aneesh**_
- The [/react-client](/react-client) directory is the root folder for the React front-end client. This is what invokes the Webassembly modules we build. The easiest places to mess up are the [package.json](/react-client/package.json) and [webpack.config.js](/react-client/config/webpack.config.js) files. Please pay close attention to those when following along.
- The [/wasm](/wasm) directory is the root folder for our Rust source that'll compile into WASM. The easiest places to mess up are in the [src/lib.rs](/wasm/src/lib.rs) and [Cargo.toml](/wasm/Cargo.toml) files. Watch the indention and spelling on some of the macros and depedencies. Ensure the spacing is exact in the `Cargo.toml` file.
- The [/wasm-build](/wasm-build) directory is a generated source directory, and conventionally shouldn't be commited or pushed to Github. Use it if you want to skip the Rust part (I assure you it's simple enough to follow along) and skip directly to linking between React and Webassembly. You shouldn't have to make any manual changes to this directory because it's all generated by the [BUILD](/wasm/BUILD) file.

## 🚀 Getting started

To test application you need to have `node` (`yarn` is optional)

Then you can clone the repository.

git clone https://github.com/azagatti/react-wasm

1. `cd react-client`
2. `yarn` or `npm install`
3. `yarn start` or `npm start`
